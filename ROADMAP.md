# FramePack AI Video Generator Improvement Roadmap

Based on a review of the [FramePack paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12626) and the current implementation, this roadmap outlines key improvement opportunities for the AI video generator.

## 1. FramePack Implementation Enhancements

### Core Architecture Improvements
- **Expanded FramePack Variants**: Implement additional FramePack structures as described in the paper (symmetric progression, progression with important start, etc.).
- **Patchify Kernel Configuration Options**: Add support for different kernel size combinations to better align with the paper's variants.
- **Independent Patchifying Parameters**: Enhance initialization and training of independent parameters for different compression rates.

### Anti-Drifting Sampling Methods
- **Inverted Temporal Order**: Optimize the inverted order sampling that provides the best results across most metrics.
- **Endpoint-First Approach**: Enhance the anti-drifting method with early-established endpoints.
- **Bi-directional Context Enhancement**: Strengthen the bi-directional context approach that prevents drifting.

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### Memory Efficiency
- **Dynamic Compression Rate Adjustment**: Automatically adjust compression rates based on input video length.
- **TeaCache Optimization**: Fine-tune TeaCache implementation with better thresholds and rescale functions.
- **Tail Options Implementation**: Support for all three tail options (delete, append, compress) with automatic selection.

### Computational Efficiency
- **Optimized RoPE Alignment**: Streamline RoPE implementation for better performance.
- **Attention Optimization**: Implement more efficient attention mechanisms with optimized CUDA kernels.
- **Flow Shift Parameter Tuning**: Better tune flow shift parameters based on the paper's findings.

## 3. Quality Improvements

### Visual Quality
- **Balanced Diffusion Schedulers**: Implement more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.
- **Multi-Frame Generation**: Optimize for generating 9 frames per section as recommended by the paper.
- **Dynamic Start-End Contrast**: Implement quality metrics to measure and minimize drifting effects automatically.

### Consistency
- **Temporal Consistency Enhancement**: Add specific features to improve consistency between frames.
- **Identity Preservation**: Improve identity preservation across video frames.
- **Anti-Forgetting Improvements**: Strengthen anti-forgetting mechanisms to maintain consistent visual elements.

## 4. User Experience & Interface

### Gradio Interface
- **Advanced Parameter Control**: Expose more underlying parameters for advanced users.
- **Progress Visualization**: Enhance progress visualization to show multi-frame generation.
- **Preset Configurations**: Add preset configurations for different types of video generation tasks.

### Functionality
- **Variable Resolution Support**: Better handling of different input and output resolutions.
- **Batch Processing**: Add support for processing multiple images in a batch.
- **Export Options**: More export format options beyond MP4.

## 5. Architecture & Code Structure

### Modularity
- **Better Component Separation**: Clearer separation between model, sampling logic, and interface.
- **Configuration Management**: Move hardcoded parameters to configuration files.
- **Pipeline Abstraction**: Create a more abstract pipeline interface for easier experimentation.

### Code Quality
- **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive docstrings and comments.
- **Type Hints**: Implement more consistent type hints throughout the codebase.
- **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for core components.
